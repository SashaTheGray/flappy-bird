# Exploring NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies with Flappy Bird

---

## Introduction

NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT)
is an evolutionary algorithm that creates artificial neural networks.

## Notes

### Key ideas

- Genetic encoding
- Historical marking crossover
- Speciation
- Explicit fitness sharing
- Minimal structure of initialization


### Genome (Genotype):

- Node gene set
  - Input nodes, hidden nodes, output nodes
- Connection gene set
  - In, Out, Weight, Enabled, Innovation number

### Network (Phenotype)

- Either adds a node, or adds a connection
